# Key-Morph-Vigenere-Cipher
This C++ program implements a variant of the classic Vigenère cipher, enhanced with a dynamic "key morphing" mechanism. In this symmetric key cryptography system, the encryption key evolves by incrementing each character (shifting letters alphabetically) after every full cycle through the key, creating a more complex and adaptive cipher.
